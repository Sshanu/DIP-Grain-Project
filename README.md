Step 1)
So initially I have 10 images of good quality grain. Our first step is a Pre-Processing step, where we reject those images where spread of grain is not appropriate. Image files are named as indexno_y.jpg for acceptable spread, and indexno_n.jpg for not acceptable spread.
The preprocessing step should be able to reject those files which don't have proper spread.
Step 2)
From each good image, seperate all the grains, and save them as cropped images.
P.S. I haven't gone to market to purchase the bad quality grain. I'll do i in 2-3 days.
